Fixed Bugs
----------
Set show free space on and show unknown off.
Scan a diskette (slow drive)
Set "show unknown" on.
--> The program doesn't crash.
[If you don't have a diskette drive (that's my situation :-( ),
replace 600 ms by 5 in windirstat.cpp, line: if (doc != NULL && !doc->Work(600)),
and scan a HD instead.]

Scan a folder with only a view files so that the extension list
has no vertical scroll bar.
Refresh All.
--> The header control of the extension list repaints correctly.

Expand some folders and scroll down the directory list
--> The list doesn't flicker.
Scroll down the extension list
--> The list doesn't flicker.

Repeatedly make the color column in the extension list
small and wide again
--> No crash.

Directory list: Change the column order so that the name column
is not the first column. Right-click on a name. 
--> The context menu does appear.
Double-click on a name.
--> The item expands.

Drive Selection Dialog: Select "a folder" and enter a relative 
path (like .) into the filename field. Press OK.
--> The root item has its path expanded.
Enter a folder name with trailing backslash, like C:\temp\. Press OK.
--> The trailing backslash is removed.
In a network enter an UNC path to the filename field via keyboard.
--> OK button is enabled, no validation-delay.


Open the task manager.

Open windirstat again.

Open the drive selection dialog again.
